SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION refers to the method of making a website exist and be accessed by other people so that it can gain popularity and subsequent value.  This is done by constructing the website and analyzing the content so that the keywords that will be typed into the search engine by potential customers will lead them to the site that has been indexed already.

<p>
By placing your business in the various search engines, SEO makes it easier for people to have as much information as they would want regarding your business. By making it more detailed, potential customers have a clear idea of what they want and what they expect to get if they come to your site or business to purchase your products and/or services.  This is also a boost in the case of websites that are businesses in themselves.  For example, eBay, which is an online store, optimizes their site several times per day.  Also, with the aid and assistance of merchant bank accounts, there is a good possibility that a business that has partnered with SEO will have a huge financial boost, due to the ease of doing business for their customers.</p>

<p>One of the downsides to SEO, however, is neglect of a site that has once been optimized. There exists the possibility of detouring on the website if the SEO has resulted in broken links. Broken links can cause frustration to shoppers as it makes shopping hard.</p>

<p>Overall, however, SEO is a great way to streamline your website and gain popularity, thus making your website and your overall business more valuable.</p>
